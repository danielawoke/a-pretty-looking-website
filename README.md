Your majesty,

This project is just a website made to show off some graphic front end skills.
When trying to analyze what factors make a website a high quality one, I concluded that good
interactive animations are the key component. As a result I made this website with that idea
in mind. You can move the clouds around, and the earth spins

Keep spinning the planet and see what happens

Regards from you're passing client, Daniel Awoke
