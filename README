Your majesty,

This project is just a cool little website made to show off some graphic front end skills.
When trying to analyze what factors make a website a high quality one, I concluded that good
interactive animations are the key component. As a result I made this website with that idea
in mind. You can move the clouds around, and the earth spins

Keep spinning the planet and see what happens

Regards from you're passing client, Daniel Awoke

THIS ONLY WORKS ON CHROME. IF YOU USE THIS ON FIRE FOX IT THE EARTH WILL ZIP PAST YOUR SCREEN.

I'll probably fix it later but just keep that in mind.
